# RL
TO build a universal fundamental DQN network which can be used with every beginners.
this code may only have the part of DQN,others such as the part of enviroment and operation may update later.
this project is still updating,I'm also a AL beginner,this code maybe(fine, must)have lots of  bugs,but, I'm working on it~
And thanks to Morvan Zhou ,his course teach me a lot,this code uses the experience of his course code in somewhere.
I hope I could code better than him and help people which want to learn about AL (^_^)
